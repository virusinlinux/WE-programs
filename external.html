        Is there a war between Russia and Ukraine?
     </h6>
     <p>Following a Russian military build-up on the Russiaâ€“Ukraine border from late 2021, the war expanded significantly when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.
        What is reason for Russia and Ukraine conflict?
        Russia and Ukraine have had no formal diplomatic relations since 24 February 2022. The Russian Federation and Ukraine are currently in a state of war: the Russo-Ukrainian War began in 2014 following the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine across a broad front.
